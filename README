This is an experimental core calculus for the Hacksmith editor.

The goals: 
  * Fluid-assumption workflow -- i.e. paying attention to and
    constantly shifting your state of knowledge.
  * System for expressing and easily manipulating knowledge about the
    program (generalization of types)
  * Macro system, executing code while you are working to help you.
    Perhaps prototype a "regex-like" language for manipulating the 
    program.

Basically it is prototyping the essential ideas of Hacksmith without
worrying about presentation or bindings to existing languages.  If I can
work with programs at the command line, then an editor will only help.
